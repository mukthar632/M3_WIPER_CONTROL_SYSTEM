# INTRODUCTION
- A windshield wiper or wiper blade is a device which is used to remove rain, snow, ice, washer fluid, water, from a vehicle's front window. 
- Every heavy  motor vehicles including cars, trucks , train locomotives and some aircraftâ€”are installed  with such wipers .
- After reading several research papers , I understood that safety requirements under unfavourable weather condition is necessary even at low speed also for motor vehicles and therefore I started making wiper control system using arm based microcontrollers. 
- It consist of rubber blades attached at its metal arms with pivot magnets at its other ends.
- Finally this project application helps users in day to day life and prevents accidents and allows safe and healthy journey.
