# INTRODUCTION
- A windshield wiper or wiper blade is a device which is used to remove rain, snow, ice, washer fluid, water, from a vehicle's front window. 
- Every heavy  motor vehicles including cars, trucks , train locomotives and some aircraftâ€”are installed  with such wipers .
- After reading several research papers , I understood that safety requirements under unfavourable weather condition is necessary even at low speed also for motor vehicles and therefore I started making wiper control system using arm based microcontrollers. 
- It consist of rubber blades attached at its metal arms with pivot magnets at its other ends.
- Finally this project application helps users in day to day life and prevents accidents and allows safe and healthy journey.

## RESEARCH
This application is researched from various sources (like you tube , google and research papers ) and then I have modified into successful working model application of wiper control system using arm based microcontrollers. 

## END GOAL
- Clear vision in adverse weather conditions .
- Avoid accidents and ensure safety with latest mechanism.

### Who
-   Everyone who wants safety and clear vision of road in driving using motor vehicles.
### What
-   Wiper Control System for motor vehicles.
### Why
-   Curious about carrier in embedded system . 
### When 
-   When you understand the importance of safety management and start to be accountable for your health during driving motor vehicles in unfavourable weather conditions.
### Where
-   This can be  used by the user in day to day life where they can track their safety and  generate better results in life during travelling via motor vehicles  .
### How
-   LED shows the position of wiper and it will return to the original position after cleaning windsheet of motor vehicles  .
